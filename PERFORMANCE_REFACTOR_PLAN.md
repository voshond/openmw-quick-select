# Hotbar Performance Refactoring Plan üöÄ

## Current Performance Issues (The Disaster Assessment)

### üî• Critical Problems Identified:

#### 1. **Constant Full UI Rebuilds**

- `drawHotbar()` called everywhere - 20+ locations in codebase
- Every update destroys and recreates entire UI from scratch
- No differentiation between full redraw and incremental updates
- Like rebuilding your house to change a light bulb

#### 2. **Aggressive Timer-Based Updates**

- Enchantment charge timer runs every 0.5 seconds (`REFRESH_INTERVAL = 0.5`)
- Always triggers full `drawHotbar(false)` when enchanted items present
- Results in 2+ full UI rebuilds per second
- No user control over update frequency

#### 3. **Zero Smart Caching**

- No state caching or dirty flag system
- Every update recalculates everything from scratch
- No tracking of what actually changed
- Expensive operations repeated unnecessarily

#### 4. **Brute Force State Management**

- All state changes trigger full redraws
- No delta tracking for charges, counts, equipped status
- No batching of multiple changes
- Update spam protection non-existent

#### 5. **Missing Optimization Patterns**

- No visibility-based update gating
- No configurable update intervals
- No element reuse or modification
- No smart throttling mechanisms

## Competitor Analysis (Learning from ZerkishHotkeysImproved)

### ‚úÖ Smart Patterns They Use:

1. **Delta Updates**: Only update when `hb != lastHotbar` or interval passes
2. **Configurable Intervals**: User-controllable update frequency via `sUpdateInterval`
3. **Visibility Management**: Only update when `isHudVisible` is true
4. **Incremental Updates**: `updateHUD()` modifies existing elements instead of recreating
5. **Smart State Tracking**: Track previous state to detect actual changes

---

## Refactoring Strategy (4-Phase Master Plan)

### üöÄ **Phase 1: Smart Update System Foundation**

**Goal**: Replace brute force updates with intelligent change detection

#### Tasks:

1. **Implement State Tracking**

   - Add delta tracking for all hotbar state (charges, counts, equipped status)
   - Create state comparison functions to detect actual changes
   - Track previous vs current state for each slot

2. **Separate Update Types**

   - `fullRedraw()` - Complete UI rebuild (rare, user-triggered)
   - `incrementalUpdate()` - Update only changed elements (frequent)
   - `refreshSlot(slotNum)` - Update single slot only

3. **Add Configurable Update Intervals**

   - User setting for update frequency (0.1s to 5.0s range)
   - Separate intervals for different update types
   - Smart scheduling based on activity level

4. **Implement Update Gating**
   - Only update when hotbar is actually visible
   - Skip updates during UI transitions
   - Throttle rapid successive update requests

#### Files to Modify:

- `qs_hotbar.lua` - Main update logic refactor
- `ci_icon_render.lua` - Timer and refresh system overhaul
- `qs_settings.lua` - Add new performance settings

---

### üéØ **Phase 2: Element Caching & Reuse**

**Goal**: Cache UI elements and modify properties instead of recreating

#### Tasks:

1. **Implement UI Element Cache**

   - Cache hotbar slot containers and reuse them
   - Track which elements need updates vs recreation
   - Implement proper element lifecycle management

2. **Smart Property Updates**

   - Update icon textures without recreating image elements
   - Modify text content without recreating text elements
   - Change colors/alpha without full element replacement

3. **Dirty Flag System**

   - Flag system to track which slots need updates
   - Batch multiple changes into single update cycles
   - Clear flags after successful updates

4. **Memory Management**
   - Proper cleanup of unused cached elements
   - Prevent memory leaks from stale references
   - Monitor cache size and implement limits

#### Files to Modify:

- `qs_hotbar.lua` - Add caching layer
- `ci_icon_render.lua` - Element reuse logic
- New file: `qs_cache_manager.lua` - Cache management

---

### ‚ö° **Phase 3: Optimize Update Triggers**

**Goal**: Minimize unnecessary updates and improve responsiveness

#### Tasks:

1. **Smart Timer Management**

   - Replace fixed 0.5s timer with configurable intervals
   - Implement adaptive timing based on activity
   - Add timer pause/resume based on visibility

2. **Event-Driven Updates**

   - React to actual game events instead of polling
   - Update only affected slots when items change
   - Batch related changes together

3. **Update Throttling**

   - Prevent update spam from rapid state changes
   - Implement debouncing for frequent triggers
   - Queue updates and process in batches

4. **Priority-Based Updates**
   - High priority: User interactions, equipped items
   - Medium priority: Charge changes, count updates
   - Low priority: Background state refreshes

#### Files to Modify:

- `ci_icon_render.lua` - Timer optimization
- `qs_hotbar.lua` - Event handling improvement
- `ci_favorite_storage.lua` - Reduce unnecessary update calls

---

### üèÜ **Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations**

**Goal**: Fine-tune performance and add advanced features

#### Tasks:

1. **State Diffing Engine**

   - Implement proper state comparison algorithms
   - Track granular changes (charge deltas, count changes)
   - Predict which updates are needed before processing

2. **Calculation Caching**

   - Cache expensive item data lookups
   - Store enchantment information between updates
   - Implement intelligent cache invalidation

3. **Rendering Optimizations**

   - Minimize texture loading operations
   - Optimize UI layout calculations
   - Reduce string concatenations and table operations

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance metrics and logging
   - Track update frequencies and durations
   - Provide user feedback on performance impact

#### Files to Modify:

- All hotbar-related files for final optimization
- New file: `qs_performance_monitor.lua` - Performance tracking
- `qs_settings.lua` - Advanced performance settings
